ðŸ‘‹ Hello, i'm Cezar, a brazilian developer that loves Python, cats and Jack Stauber (although some friends believe i only listen to kpop).

ðŸ“¦ Among my projects you'll find a lot of Telegram chatbots and content related to home automation, which are two subjects that i am fascinated about.

ðŸ“± I started programming back in 2017, using a broken LG G3 - in a terrible state, i should say - and since then my main objective in programming has been to make either useful (like pyromod and silentc) or cool projects (like wstreaming and tv-card). I used mostly PHP, Python and JavaScript for the projects, but i'm also open to experiment new technologies (i have Go and Rust in the to-try-list).
